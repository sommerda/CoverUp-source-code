				<h5 class="w3-padding-32">Abstract</h5>

				<p class="w3-text-grey">
					Anonymous communication networks (ACNs) are basic building blocks for obtaining or exchanging data in a privacy-preserving manner. ACNs suffer from a bootstrapping problem: having few users leads to a small anonymity set, which renders the ACN unattrac- tive. We propose a system, CoverUp, that tackles the bootstrapping problem for ACNs. The key idea is to draw in non-ACN users from a collaborating website to connect to an ACN after an informed consent via a JavaScript snippet, thereby triggering them to passively participate (as passive participants). CoverUp implements a privacy-preserving broadcast with a downlink rate of 10 to 50 Kbit/s that renders the traffic of these passive participants indistinguishable from active participants. If this broadcast is accessed via an ACN with a constant-rate traffic pattern, CoverUp contributes active participants with legitimate-looking traffic, thus helping in bootstrapping the ACN. To protect active participants from potentially incriminating broadcast-data, an additional application is needed to extract any information from CoverUp’s broadcast. The indistin- guishability guarantee of CoverUp for broadcasts holds against global network-level attackers that control ev- erything except for the user’s machine. In addition, as long as active participants do not change their surfing behavior on these websites due to CoverUp, they hide their participation time, i.e., do not leak the time at which they listen to the broadcast, which counters intersection and statistical disclosure attacks. As passive participation raises ethical and legal concerns for the collaborating websites and the participants, we discuss these concerns and describe how they can be addressed.
				</p>
				<p class="w3-text-grey">
					We extend CoverUp to bi-directional point-to-point communication (e.g., messengers) with an up- and downlink rate of 10 to 50 Kbit/s. Bi-directional CoverUp can offer users of ACNs with constant-rate traffic an additional entry point that hides their participation time (as above). The indistinguishability for bi-directional CoverUp requires the integrity of the JavaScript snippet, for which we introduce a trusted party. We give evidence that with a latency of 3 seconds (including the random delays) the timing leakage is undetectable, even after a year of continual observation. As long as the timing leakage is undetected, bi-directional CoverUp achieves the same properties as for broadcasts against network-level attackers that control everything except for the user’s machine and the trusted party.

				<h1>General Setup</h1>
				<p>This prototype implementation demonstrates both Message Feed (uni-directional) and Chat (bi-directional channel). The Message Feed works both with <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a> and <a href="https://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a> (or <a href="https://www.google.ch/chrome/browser/desktop/">Google Chrome</a>). However, the bi-directional channel (the messenger) works with Chromium only.
					<p> To get the prototype working, follow these steps: </p>

							Now a data packets is downloaded. For this demo, we set the parameters according to the specification in our <a href=#report>technical report</a>. The iframe waits a random amount of seconds uniformly distributed in [1,5] seconds, before it dispatches the first request. After this, it requests periodically data again uniformly distributed in [1,5] seconds.  To read the feed or to use the bidirectional channel, you need to start the external application:

								Execute the CoverUp.jar file by either double clicking it or in console "java -jar NinjaPumpkin&lt; platform &gt;.jar". Make sure you have Java version 1.8 and Python27 installed. ( <font color="red">important : windows users are needed to run the application with admin privilege</font>)
							</li>
							<li>
								You will see this following window. Select the option BROWSER_NATIVE_MESSAGE to select Google Chrome as the primary browser for messenger (bi-directional channel). In this mode, the application listen on the TCP port 56789 from the browser extension to receive information. BROWSER_FIREFOX is for settting Mozilla Firefox but is implemented to receive the unidirectional message feed only. BROWSER_CHROME selects Google chrome as the primary browser for unidirectional message feed on. Both BROWSER_CHROME and BROWSER_FIREFOX polls the localstorage database (cache database of the browser located in the disk) to fetch information.
								We strongly recommend use BROWSER_CHROME option as the latter is in experimental stage.

							<h1>Messenger Application</h1>

							<ol type="1">

								<li> 
									<p>
										Both the chat application in interactive browsing depend on the Chromium browser extension. The communication between the application and the extension is executed via native messaging. This requires some initial setup: First, restart the External Java Application in the mode BROWSER_NATIVE_MESSAGE instead of BROWSER_CHROME. Second, install the required NativeMessaging files. To automate this process go to settings &#8594; Native Messaging Setup. On Windows, this will prompt you to select the python.exe file. On Linux, you need python installed (and accessible in a directory listed in the corresponding $PATH environment vaiable) which should be a part of the default configuration of most Linux distributions.

									<img src="images/chat/2.JPG" height = "512"> 
								</li>

								<li> 
									<p>
										To set up the chatting, we need to first understand how the chatting infrastructure works. Open the file APP_DATA which is located where the NinjaPumpkin&ltplatform&gt.jar is located. Navigate to the "chat" directory. "KeyFile.key" is already generated by the application which is your credential containing your public address, public key and private key. Keep this file secure. Without this file any chat directed to you would be irrecoverable. Provide the public key to the people to who want to send messages to you. "PkList.txt" is a empty file where you have to provide the public keys of the people you want to chat with. "LOGS" contains older chat in plain text as a backup.
									</p>
									<img src="images/chat/3.JPG" height = "150"> 
								</li>

								<li> 
									<p>
										This is a snapshot of "pkList.txt". The public keys generated by the CoverUp application are encoded in Base64 format. You can add a new public key by putting it into the text field named "remote public key" and press the button "Add Remote PK". Alternatively you can add a new public key in the file "pkList.txt", each in a new line.
									</p>
									<img src="images/chat/4.JPG" height = "512"> 
								</li>


								<li> 
									<p> 
										This is a snapshot of your key file in JSON format. address is your public address, sk and pk are your private and public key respectively. Keep this file as a backup in a separate location. You should give the pk to the people whom you want to chat with. 
									</p>
									<img src="images/chat/5.JPG" height = "128"> </li>

									<li> 
										<p>
											Now go to the chat application, there is a drop down menu which lists all the public keys in your list including unlisted public keys where you received at least one chat. Switch to different addresses to record chat.
